# Contributing to React Native Mask Text

First off, _thank you_ for considering contributing to the React Native Community. The community-supported packages are only possible because of amazing people like you.

Secondly, we'd like the contribution experience to be as good as possible. While we are a small all-volunteer team, we are happy to hear feedback about your experience, and if we can make the docs or experience better please let us know.

### Testing in a new `react-native init` or `expo init` project

In a new `react-native init` or `expo init` project, do this:

```shell
$ yarn add ../react-native-mask-text
```
